## Part 1 (You can copy code from last time if you have it for this part)
### New York City Flights 13

- `flights` [336,776 x 16]. Every flight leaving NYC in 2013.
- `weather` [ 8719 x 14]. Hourly Weather Data.
- `planes` [3322 x 9]. Plane data.
- `airports` [1397 x 7]. Airport data.


```{r}
library(nycflights13)
library(dplyr)
flights
```

### Basic Dplyr

The `dplyr` package uses verbs to perform data manipulation.

- `filter()` and `slice()`
- `arrange()`
- `select()` and `rename()`
- `distinct()`
- `mutate()` and `transmute()`
- `sample_n()` and `sample_frac()`

### Filtering Rows

1. Filter all flights on your birthday.
2. Filter all flights in rows 567 - 589


### Arranging Rows
3. Use arrange() to order the data by year, month and day
4. Use desc() to arrange flights by arrival delay.


### Select
5. Select columns containing data information.
6. Select columns including only plane information.
7. Rename tailnum to tail_num


### Mutating Rows
8. Create a variable called gain which describes the difference between arrival delap and departure delay.
9. Create a variable called speed which is distance over time in hours.


###Summarise
10. Summarise the average delay for all flights.

## Overall Questions

11. Split the complete dataset into individual planes and then summarise each plane by counting the number of flights (count = n()) and computing the average distance and arrival delay . Then plot this:


12. Find the number of planes and the number of flights that go to each possible destination.

### More Difficult

We learned about piping our commands. The goal of piping is to help use with the flow of our analysis. The steps we take are:
- Think about it. 
- Describe it. 
- Do it.

13. Consider the code Below:

```
filter(
  summarise(
    select(
      group_by(flights, year, month, day),
      arr_delay, dep_delay
    ),
    arr = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
    dep = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
  ),
  arr > 30 | dep > 30
)
```

a. What are some problems with this function?
b. How easy is it to follow the logic of this?
c. Rewrite this using piping to make it more understandable.
d. Does your rewritten command give the same results?

## Setup

The first chunk in an R Notebook is usually titled "setup," and by convention includes the R packages you want to load. Remember, in order to use an R package you have to run some `library()` code every session. Execute these lines of code to load the packages. 

```{r setup}
library(ggplot2)
library(gapminder)
```


## Gapminder Data 

Excerpt of the [Gapminder](http://www.gapminder.org/data/) data on life expectancy, GDP per capita, and population by country. We will be using the unfiltered data which can be called with the code chunk below:

```{r}
gapminder_unfiltered
```


## On your own: RStudio Practice #1

- Set `alpha=year` instead of `alpha=1/100`. How does this change things?
- Set `alpha=pop` instead of `alpha=1/100`. How does this change things?

```{r}
ggplot(data=gapminder, aes(x=gdpPercap, y=lifeExp)) + 
  geom_point(aes(alpha=1/100))
```

## On Your Own: RStudio Practice #2

- Set `color="blue"`
- How does this change things?

```{r, echo=F}
ggplot(data=gapminder_unfiltered, aes(x=gdpPercap, y=lifeExp)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color="continent"))
```




## On Your Own: RStudio Practice #3

- There is also a way to change binwidths on a histogram. 
- Try the code below and change the `binwidth`.


```{r, echo=F}
ggplot(data=gapminder_unfiltered, aes(x=lifeExp)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth=1)
```




## On Your Own: RStudio Practice #4

- We can actually save plots.
- Then we can add layers to a named plot
- Run the code line by line below to see how this works


```{r, echo=F}
p <- ggplot(data=gapminder_unfiltered, aes(x=gdpPercap, y=lifeExp))
p

p1 <- p +  geom_point() 
p1

p2 <- p1 + geom_smooth(method="lm")
p2


p3 <- p2 + theme_bw()
p3


p4 <- p3 + geom_smooth(method="lm", aes(color=continent))
p4
```

## On Your Own: RStudio Practice #9

- In this example we will use the dataset `population` that is part of tidyverse. 
- Print this data:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
head(population,1)
```



- You should see the table that we have above, now We have a variable named `year`, assume that we wish to actually have each year as its own variable. 
- Using the `spread()` function, redo this data so that each year is a variable. 
- Your data will look like this at the end:
 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
population %>% 
  
  
```



## On Your Own: RStudio Practice #10

- Create `population2` from last example:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
population2 <- population %>% 
                    spread(year, population)
```

- Now gather the columns that are labeled by year and create columns `year` and `population`. 

```{r}
population2 %>%
  
```
